improve AI {
	build 3D cylinder intersection engine (distance to intersection, evade point in space-time)
	state machine (searching, positioning, aiming, suicide / escaping, turret)
	
	improve controller design (currently not able to force call of command functions + not access to dt etc...)
	{
		command_object => fighter calls own functions
		pass object & objects as const
	}
	
	build pid engine for controls
	test: easiest state first: turret
}

improve game? {
	unnable tu turn if vel too low?
	improve feel
	add obstacles ?
}

begin modeling evolution simmulation {
	being able to visualize evolution
	if no munitions left in objects => winner max life
	evolution sim loop does a generation by frames
	then display the results
	evolution game object
}

ai evolution mode {
	???
}

add interesting mechanics {
	damage proportional to kinetic energy
}
