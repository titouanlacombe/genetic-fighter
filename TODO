improve AI {
	3- estimate bullet travel time, aim accordingely, with target current speed
	states (evading, aiming, suicide)
	pid for targets
	when no focus => state search
	no munitions => suicide
	no fuel => turret
}

improve game? {
	unnable tu turn if vel too low?
	improve feel
	add obstacles ?
	improve controller design (currently not able to force call of command functions + not access to dt etc...)
}

begin modeling evolution simmulation {
	being able to visualize evolution
	if no munitions left in objects => winner max life
	evolution sim loop does a generation by frames
	then display the results
	evolution game object
}

ai evolution mode {
	???
}

add interesting mechanics {
	damage proportional to kinetic energy
}
